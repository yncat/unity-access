# unity-access
This repository contains my editor extension that makes Unity game engine a little bit more accessible for screen reader users.

# Usage
If the editor extension is properly set up, it will do following:
* Makes a sound when the game view is toggled
* Tells the compiler status (still buggy)
* Dumps console log to a text file
* Speaks errors aloud (still buggy)

# Supported screen readers
* pctalker
* NVDA

# Tested Unity version
5.6.1 (too old)
